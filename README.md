## Why you should build repeatable blocks to your forms?

There are instances in which you don’t know how many fields the user needs to fill out in the form. As a result, by allowing users to add fields to your forms, you may make the form more adaptable for various use cases.

*For example,* they want to add extra fields for people to write comments or indicate designs, colors, sizes, and other details about their uniform order. This ensures that you receive all of the information required to properly complete an order.

You should notice that the flexibility and functionality of the form on your website can be improved with the Gravity Forms Repeater Field to provide a great user experience. Because users are given the freedom to add the relevant elements on their own. It aids in the production of clear and engaging forms that do not leave out any important information from users.
